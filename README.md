# Othello Game

This project is an implementation of the board game, [Othello](https://www.worldothello.org/about/about-othello/othello-rules/official-rules/english).

[Screenshots](screenshots) of login/register pages and gameplay are provided in the repository.

## How To Play

Game works with two players. Since it only runs on the current computer, it assumes that both players will play the game on the same computer. As the project has no netcode, first thing to do is creating two accounts from register page which can be accessible from login page.

After login, program is redirected to main session where you choose the board size and initiate the game. Game, though not strictly, adheres to Othello's rules which is linked in the header paragraph.

Program can be run from [Login.java](src/main/java/com/ertu/proje3/OthelloLogin.java).
